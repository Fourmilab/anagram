# Anagram Finder

Anagram Finder is a program which finds anagrams (based on a standard
dictionary used in that crossword game whose name can't be spoken
without summoning lawyers) for a phrase you specify.

The program is written in C++ and developed with the CWEB Literate
Programming language. with the source code and documentation in
the file `src/anagram.w` and development log in `src/log.w`.  The
program files and documents are generated from these files by CWEB.
Changes should be made to the original code in the `.w` files, not
the files derived from them.  Instructions for building the program
are in `src/INSTALL`.

User documentation and annotated source code are in the file
`src/anagram.pdf`.
